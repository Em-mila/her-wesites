        <h1>About Her &hearts;</h1>
        <p>
            Fitri Febriana is not just "a girl", she's my world. She's the most lovely person i know.
            She was born on 1st February 1997, one of the Aquarius babies. Yup,cold. Like a 28 doors refrigator.
            I still can't believe that i was the one who could melt her heart and made her mine.
            She lives in West Java Province. So far from my city. She's an introvert, hate crowded room so much.
            She prefer to sit in a Cafe alone with a cup of warm coffee and her favorite book. She loves reading poem.
            I found it really clever, because it's hard to find people who likes reading poem book.
            Bunch of people rather to read novel or comics instade of poems.
            She's really a calm person, loves chill and really not a fan of something 'complicated'.
            Her heart is the most beautiful thing of her. Her heart isn't made of a metal,it was made of flowers.
            Yes,just like flowers...Beautiful inside out,unique,colorful and full of butterflies. Like once you see the true color of her heart,
            you will fall in love easily. She always thinks that she isn't a romantic person nor a sweet person,but i 100% disagree with that.
            She doesn't know how worthy she is, how 'more than enough' she is for me right now.
        
        <br>She got a biggest power of controlling me. The master of my heart,my body,my energy,everything.
            She could easily make me feel butterflies in all over my stomacs then fuck it up easily,
            She could raise my energy so hype then make me mellow,
            She could litteraly make me sad but horny at the same time.
            She is the best thing that happened in my 2023. She's everything for me. The love of my life.
